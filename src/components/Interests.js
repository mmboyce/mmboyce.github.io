                    <p>During my time at the University of Delaware I was involved with both the <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/nsbe/">National Society of Black Engineers</a> and <a href="http://www.sigphipsi.com/aboutAboutUs.html">The Premier Engineering Fraternity, Sigma Phi Delta.</a> I was elected <b>President</b> of our chapter in November of 2018. Prior to my presidency, I was the <b>PR Chair,</b> both running our social media and designing fraternity apparel.</p>
                    <p>Presently, I spend a lot of time being active. I like to go for runs, and lift, but whem I'm not doing that I love spending time with my friends playing pickup soccer games, dancing, or playing video games. I used to rock climb pretty frequently too, so now I'm hoping to find a good bouldering gym near me!</p>
