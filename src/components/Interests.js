                    <p>At the Unversity of Delaware I have been involved with both the <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/nsbe/">National Society of Black Engineers</a> and <a href="http://www.sigphipsi.com/aboutAboutUs.html">The Premier Engineering Fraternity, Sigma Phi Delta.</a> I was elected <b>President</b> of our chapter in November of 2018. Prior to my presidency, I was the <b>PR Chair,</b> both running our Social Media and designing fraternity apparel.</p>
                    <p>Outside of my roles in on-campus organizations I spend a lot of time being active. The University of Delaware's Bouldering Gym is a place I have spent a lot of free time. If I don't feel like climbing the rock wall at the gym, I typically spend time on the turf playing Soccer with my friends.</p>
